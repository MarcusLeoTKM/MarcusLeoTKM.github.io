This was my very first PCB design. The board shown above is the second version. Compared to the first version, I changed the improper PCB layout, moved and added components to address the issues I got from the first testing results. I also added pads around the perimeter, which not only makes it more aesthetically pleasing but also allows me to use it as a programmable dev board.

I was extremely thrilled to see the board successfully flashed and working.

### Next Steps
<div style="margin-top:10px"></div>
While the current version functions as a "LED" board, my goal is to turn it into a  controller that I can carry with me and use to program peripheral devices anytime.
The board already supports several communication protocols, including SPI and I2C.
The next step is to have data readings to appear on my host computer. This would involve adding a UART-to-USB chip, the supporting circuitry, and having a USB port for wired communication.
