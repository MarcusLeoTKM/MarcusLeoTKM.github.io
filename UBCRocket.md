I had four awesome months at UBC Rocket, where I participated in two projects and a test launch in Oregon. I was responsible for soldering components at first and gradually took on some harder tasks such as PCB design, and firmware programming. 

Over the following weeks, I used Altium to create my own boards, including one made for UBC <a href="./sam-m10q.html">SAM M10Q GNSS Module</a>. I programmed and tested it using a STM32 Nucleo board via UART and it was successfully flown with the rocket at the 2025 Launch Canada competition.

### Soldering
Soldered Radio, BMS, Buck Converter, GNSS Module and Vector Thrust boards.

A little technique for soldering a 0402 component is to first apply a thin layer of solder to the pads using a soldering iron, then, place the 0402 on the pad and use a heat gun to melt the solder underneath, allowing the component to attach. No hot plate needed.

For optimal RF performance, the manual suggests using a 5 by 5 cm layout with stitching vias.
