## West Coast at Cost
Jun 2025 - Aug 2025

In the summer of 2025, I completed a mechanical internship at a local shipyard. I worked on many hands-on tasks, such as installing throttle cables, reinstalling onboard displays and assisting with the installation of the anchor system. 

<!-- 
I had a lot of fun during the internship, but poor boat designs from previous manufacturers did cause some pain. Not to mention the small engine room you had to squeeze into, or the anchor cabinet at the bow that required you to back yourself in. There was even a boat with its engine placed behind the stairs (which was very common), with only one side exposed, making it impossible to repair. Even worse, because of those layers and tight space, the engine and alternator get easily over-heated. And once that happens, you’d have to turn the engine/alternator low and wait for it to cool. The space was designed only to fit the engine and did not care for future upgrades. 


Overall, it was an awesome experience. Prior to this internship, my understanding of mechanical systems was mostly theoretical. Now, I feel like I have a much better understanding of the system as a whole. And I began to think about the potential physical constraints in my designs that might bring inconvenience to the people running my product.  -->
